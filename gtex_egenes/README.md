# GTEx eGenes

This directory contain data from the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
Project](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/); specifically, the list of eGenes
from all the tissues catalogued in GTEx.

From the description on their homepage, GTEx Project aims to "identify regions
of the genome that influence whether and how much a gene is expressed."

Most common type of data you can get from the GTEx Project are eQTLs from
various tissues, where it measures whether a variant alters the expression of
a particular gene in a particular tissue.

eGenes are genes that have at least one significant *cis*-eQTL variant
associated with its expression, and the data in this directory contains a list
of all the eGenes for each of the human tissues measured by the GTEx Project
(49 tissues in total that has >= 70 samples for eQTL analysis).

We will be using this data to practice how to use regular expressions.
