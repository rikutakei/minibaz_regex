# Regular Expression lesson for Otago MiniBaz 2020

This is the repository for the regular expression (regex) lesson at Otago
MiniBaz 2020.

There are several example files to practice regular expressions with, which
some may be of practical use in your future work and/or study.

Here is the overview of what the examples files are about:
- [`lc_regex_files`](./lc_regex_files) contain files used in the [Library Carpentry Regular Expression lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/)
- [`encode_regex`](./encode_regex) contains a meta-data file that has information on some of the publicly available data from [ENCODE project](https://www.encodeproject.org/)
- [`gtex_egenes`](./gtex_egenes) includes data on genes that have significant eQTL in various human tissues and cell types from the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/)

# TODO

- Focus more on `grep` and `sed`
- Add regex challenges to each directory
- Add READMEs to each directory
