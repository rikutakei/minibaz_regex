# Regular Expression lesson for Otago MiniBaz 2020

This is the repository for the regular expression (regex) lesson at Otago
MiniBaz 2020.

# What you need for this lesson

Only thing you will need for this lesson is a working internet, internet
browser, and access to a terminal.

If you have done the SWC bash lesson, this will not be a problem for you.

If you haven't set up your computer for the bash lesson, you can do so by
following the instructions from this [page](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).

You will also need to download this repository, either through Git on command
line or by downloading the repo as a zip file, and place it somewhere you can
access through terminal.

# Overview

There are several example files to practice regular expressions with, which
some may be of practical use in your future work and/or study.

Here is a brief overview of the example files:
- [`lc_regex_files`](./lc_regex_files) contain files used in the [Library Carpentry Regular Expression lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/)
- [`encode_regex`](./encode_regex) contains a meta-data file that has information on some of the publicly available data from [ENCODE project](https://www.encodeproject.org/)
- [`gtex_egenes`](./gtex_egenes) includes data on genes that have significant eQTL in various human tissues and cell types from the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/)

In the first part of the lesson, we will be going through the Library
Carpentry's material on regular expression to learn the basics of regex, and
how to build them.

In the second part of the lesson, we will be using real data provided in
`encode_regex` and `gtex_egenes` to practice how to use `grep`, `sed`, and
`awk` (and possibly other) programs.

# TODO

- Focus more on `grep` and `sed`
- Add regex challenges to each directory
- Add READMEs to each directory
